# BALO LABS Website Mapping Fix Report

## 🔧 Issue Fixed

**Problem**: Scanner was only finding 2-3 pages instead of all 11 pages on balolabs.com

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. Overly broad skip patterns were filtering out valid pages
2. URL patterns like `/settings`, `/admin`, `/profile` were blocking any URL containing these words
3. Pages like `/lead-collection` were incorrectly classified as transactional

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Refined Skip Patterns
**Before**: Would skip any URL containing `/settings`, `/admin`, etc.
**After**: Only skips specific patterns like `/wp-admin/`, `/user/account`

### 2. Improved URL Filtering Logic
- Made pattern matching more specific
- Checks for exact matches or proper path boundaries
- Prevents false positives on valid content pages

### 3. Added Debug Logging
- Console now shows scanning progress
- Reports links found and queue status
- Helps identify why pages might be skipped
